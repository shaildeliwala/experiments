Hello!👋 Welcome to my home on GitHub for my tutorials and experiments in data science, machine learning, and other related stuff.
Below is a list of everything I've published so far in this repository.

## [🏎️Enhance your data science workflow](https://github.com/shaildeliwala/experiments/blob/master/notebooks/Enhance%20data%20science%C2%A0workflow.ipynb)
Practical tips and guidance on how to improve your data science workflow. This notebook is a part of my _Turbocharge your Workflow_ series, which is a collection of experiences I have acquired over the years and that has helped me improve my workflow. I hope you find it useful too!

## [💻Streamlit 101: An in-depth introduction](https://github.com/shaildeliwala/experiments/blob/master/src/streamlit.py)
[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) is an awesome new tool that allows engineers to quickly build highly interactive web applications around their data, machine learning models, and pretty much anything. This tutorial is a deep dive into Streamlit with Airbnb NYC listings data.

## [📊Building a Matplotlib to Plotly chart converter](https://github.com/shaildeliwala/experiments/blob/master/notebooks/Matplotlib%20to%20Plotly%20Chart%20Conversion.ipynb)
An experiment in converting Matplotlib bar charts and scatter plots created using pandas to Plotly plots. This notebook is a part of my [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/matplotlib-to-plotly-chart-conversion-4bd260e73434) on the same topic.

## [📈Airbnb data analysis and predictions](https://github.com/shaildeliwala/experiments/blob/master/notebooks/Airbnb%20data%20analysis%20and%20predictions.ipynb)
EDA and predictive experiments on Airbnb data of New York City. In this notebook, I have treated both price prediction and number-of-guests prediction problems in two ways: as a regression problem and as a classification problem. There is a comparison of both approaches.

More stuff coming up soon! 😎
